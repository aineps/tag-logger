# TagLogger
Simple wxPython text editor for creating dated logs of tagged entries.

Create a file (accepted file types: *.txt, *.md, *.py) and begin a tag block with a ++ marker. The editor will then regard this as an entry until the next tag block. Click "Tags > Write to tag" to add these entries to the appropriate tag log. They will be added to the log with the current date.

Tag logs can be opened as files or as a dialog box with "Tags > Open tag."
